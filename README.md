# ARM-Cortex-Assembly-Functions
ARM Cortex Assembly Program - Count Ones and Maximum Value Finder
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project contains ARM Cortex-M assembly programs developed and simulated using Keil ÂµVision MDK.
The code demonstrates:

Counting the number of 1 bits in a binary number (__count_ones function).

Finding the maximum value from a list of numbers stored in memory.

Handling both signed and unsigned integer comparisons.

Two versions of the program are provided:

Version 1 â€“ Signed integer comparison using BGT (signed greater-than branch).

Version 2 â€“ Unsigned integer comparison using BLS/LS and adjusted register initialization.

ðŸ›  Tools & Environment

IDE: Keil ÂµVision MDK

Target: ARM Cortex-M (generic simulation)

Language: ARM Assembly (ARMv7-M instruction set)

Simulation: Keil debugger

ðŸ“œ Program Flow
Main Program (__main)

Initialization

Loads the number of data items to process (R6).

Sets initial maximum value registers.

Loads the base address of the number table (TAB1).

Loop (loop1)

Loads a number from the table.

Calls __count_ones subroutine.

Compares the result with the current maximum.

Updates the maximum value if a larger count is found.

Termination

Stops when all numbers have been processed (SVC 0x01).

Count Ones Subroutine (__count_ones)

Loads the bit mask in R3.

Uses ANDS to check each bit of the number.

Increments the count in R1 for every 1 bit found.

Loops until all bits are processed (32 iterations for a 32-bit number).

Returns to the main program (BX LR).

ðŸ“Š Example Data (TAB1)
Signed version
TAB1 DCD 1, 68, 2, 6, 24, 123, 720, 15

Unsigned version
TAB1 DCD 0xE123, 0x981, 0xFFFFFFFC, 0x73, 0x61B1, 0xC54, 0xD01A, 0x720, 0x4C15

ðŸš€ How to Run in Keil ÂµVision

Open Keil ÂµVision.

Create a new ARM assembly project.

Add the .s files to the project.

Select a simulation target (e.g., ARM Cortex-M3).

Build the project (F7).

Start the debugger (Ctrl + F5).

Step through the program to observe register and memory changes.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

Signed Version:

Uses BGT (Branch if Greater Than) for signed comparisons.

Maximum values are initialized with signed integer limits.

Unsigned Version:

Uses LS/BLS for unsigned comparisons.

Maximum values are initialized to unsigned integer limits.

Bit counting works for both signed and unsigned numbers since it operates at the binary level.
